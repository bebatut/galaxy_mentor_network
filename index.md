## About Galaxy Mentorship Network Program

Galaxy Mentorship Network (GMN) program is an initiative by the Galaxy Community to build her members in open source projects. 

It is run on an open enrollment basis where mentees and mentors can apply at any time of need, this is so especially because we have a lot of new members who join regularly and may immediately need someone to guide them. This is a program by Galaxy members and for Galaxy members.

## Vision

 We hope to increase the proficiency of members in the use of Galaxy tools and servers, contributing to open source projects as well as becoming active members of any of our channels and working groups.

### Benefits of the GMN program

- Mentees receive expert advice on their projects, goals, and the community.
- Shorter learning curve through the mentorship relationship.
- Members are empowered to acquire important social, organizational, and technical skills.
- Mentors grow their expertise by guiding members of the community.
- An opportunity to share experience and knowledge.
- Learning and leadership opportunity.

## Application Guidelines

### Eligibility

The Galaxy Community Mentorship program is open to everyone who meets the following requirements:

### GMentee:

- You are a member of the community i.e member of one of our channels.
- You have an intended project or you are willing to take on one of the projects suggested to you by your mentor.
- You are willing to take full responsibility for the completion of your project.
- GMentees will be required to devote about 5 hours weekly to their projects.
- Bi-weekly calls of about 30 minutes will be held between mentees and mentors.

### GMentor:

- You are an active member of the community (for example, in the channels, contributing to the Galaxy GitHub repositories, events, e.t.c)
- Willing to give detailed and timely reviews of the projects and contributions of your GMentees.

### Matching Process:

When a mentee application is submitted, Network Managers and GMentors are notified. GMentors are expected to review the potential GMentees' applications so as to select a Mentee(s) whose project, goals, and expectations match their experience, interests, or expertise.
As soon as a match occurs, the Network Manager will send mails to the GMentee(s) and Mentor. This begins the mentorship program for the pair.
