# Welcome!!

On behalf of Galaxy Project, we welcome you to **Galaxy Mentor Network**.

Whoop whoop!
## What is the Galaxy Mentor Network ?

Galaxy Mentor Network (GMN) is a community of mentors and mentees. The GMN is launching a **two-month mentoring program** designed for Galaxy community members to come together as mentors and mentees to achieve a goal, share knowledge and expertise, ask questions, receive feedback, network, and most of all, get support from peers (mentors).

This mentoring program will help members transition smoothly from one part of the community to another. It will also help members learn how to use the Galaxy tools and servers efficiently, create training material, or launch and support communities. The end goal of this project is to develop more experienced members and to speed up the growth process for new members who join the community.

The project goes to show how people-centered the Galaxy community is. **Anyone (students, engineers, researchers, etc) will have the opportunity to be mentored by topic-based experts and mentors**.
## For whom is the GMN program?

The program goes to show how people-centered the Galaxy community is. **Everyone (students,  researchers, engineers, etc) will have the opportunity to mentor and/or to be mentored by topic-based experts.**

The GMN program involves:
- **Gmentees (Galaxy Mentees)**: Galaxy members who need support and guidance from the Galaxy community members.
- **Gmentors (Galaxy Mentors)**: experienced Galaxy members who are driven by the spirit of “giving back” make their expertise and experience at Galaxy and beyond available to other Galaxy members to support them in contributing to Galaxy and transitioning from one part of the Galaxy community to another.

## How does this benefit me?

This GMN project is a **win-win for all participants**. Mentors grow in experience, gain new leadership skills and sharpen their expertise, while members can learn about open source, how to create materials, or even carry out their projects with expert supervision and guidance.

The benefits of the GMN program include:
- Mentees receive expert advice on their projects, goals, and the community.
   - Shorter learning curve through the mentorship relationship.
   - Enhancement of confidence to actively participate in the Galaxy community.
- Members are empowered to acquire important social, organizational, and technical skills.
- Mentors grow their expertise by guiding members of the community.
   - An opportunity to share experience and knowledge.
  - Learning and leadership opportunities
