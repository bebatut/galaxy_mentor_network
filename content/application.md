## Matching Process

When a mentee application is submitted, network managers and mentors are notified. GMentors are expected to review the mentees' applications so as to select a mentee(s) whose project, goals, and expectations match their experience, interests, or expertise.

As soon as a match occurs, the network manager will send mails to the mentee(s) and mentor. This begins the mentorship program for the pair.

## Benefits

- Shorter learning curve through the mentorship relationship.
- Members are empowered to acquire important social, organizational, and technical skills.
