## Eligibility

The Galaxy Community Mentorship program is open to everyone who meets the following requirements:

**Mentee:**

- You are a member of the community i.e member of one of our channels.
- You have an intended project or you are willing to take on one of the projects suggested to you by your mentor.
- You are willing to take full responsibility for the completion of your project.
- Mentees will be required to devote about 5 hours weekly to their projects.
- Meeting calls of about 30 minutes will be held between mentees and mentors every two weeks.

**Mentor:**

- You are an active member of the community (for example, in the channels, contributing to the Galaxy GitHub repositories, events, e.t.c)
- Willing to give detailed and timely reviews of the projects and contributions of your mentees.
- You are willing to meet with the mentee every 2 weeks for a 30 minutes call.
- Mentors will be required to mentor for at least 8 weeks.
- Mentors will be expected to recommend helpful projects if the mentee has no intended projects during application.

## Matching Process

We try to **take into account** the reality that everybody (including the Network Managers) is **busy** and **nobody is working only on the Galaxy Mentor Network**.

So, instead of trying to scan and send applications on the fly, we would like to use a **timeframe of 2 months** (which also corresponds to the duration of the program).

People can **apply whenever they want, like a rolling admission**. But the Network Manager will **only process** applications **every 2 months**. Our process will change as well. We will:
* Format the application
* Scan them, possibly rejecting the ones where the expectations are too large, not timely or could be done by following some training or are a pure research/data analysis project
* Copy interesting applications into a Google document
* Share the Google document with GMentors and **give them 2 weeks** to express their interest
    * If a GMentor expresses interest, the Network Managers will connect them with their GMentee match
    * If no one expresses interest within a 2 week time frame, we will contact potential GMentors and encourage the match


## Benefits
